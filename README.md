Appointment Management System (AMS)
The Appointment Management System (AMS) is a web application built with Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. This system allows users to manage appointments, sign up for accounts, log in, and perform various administrative tasks.

Features
User Authentication: Users can sign up for accounts and log in securely using bcrypt for password hashing.
Appointment Booking: Users can book appointments, and the system generates a unique booking ID for each appointment.
Admin Panel: Administrators have access to an admin panel where they can manage various aspects of the system.
Database Integration: AMS integrates with SQLite for data storage, allowing for efficient data retrieval and management.
